# MAINTAINED: Tool-Augmented AI for Wireless Network Deployment

**MAINTAINED** (autonoMous Artificial INTelligence Agent for Wireless NEtwork Deployment) is a hybrid framework that replaces parametric LLMs with computational grounding. It orchestrates specialized tools for geographic reasoning, propagation modeling, and optimization to support efficient, hallucination-free wireless network planning.

## üöÄ Project Goals

This framework demonstrates how tool-based agents can outperform traditional LLMs like ChatGPT in real-world wireless network deployment tasks.
